## Elevator Pitch

Right after a game, a player usually already senses what went wrong — but that instinct fades within days and never turns into data. **Chess Log** captures it: tag the handful of moments that mattered, in a preset vocabulary or your own words, and watch how the *pattern* of your mistakes shifts over weeks and months — not just whether you're making fewer of them, but whether you've graduated to harder ones.

---

## 1. Summary

Chess Log lets a player mark specific moments in a reviewed game with a short, self-defined reason, then view how those reasons trend over time — by category, with a narrative summary alongside the charts.

The goal is not engine-driven move classification (CARA already does that well). It's **player self-diagnosis**: the human decides what mattered and why, the system remembers it, and helps them see the shape of their own game over time.

### 1.1 Existing Frameworks

Chess Log adapts existing frameworks rather than inventing new methodology:

- **CLAMP** — a categorization of common cognitive failure modes in a player's thinking process, developed by **Dr. Can Kabadayi**.
- **CCT** (Checks, Captures, Threats) — long-standing, widely used chess wisdom rather than one person's named framework.
- **The 3x3 Method** — a structured post-game reflection technique developed by **GM Noel Studer**: find exactly three moments per game worth a takeaway, and for each one ask three "Whys." Reference: [YouTube — "How To Analyze Your Chess Games (the simple way)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shma5hsckww), [written summary](https://chemcoolchess.co.za/blog/Better-Chess-Analysis-The-3x3-Method).

Chess Log's own contribution is the tagging/recording layer and the trend reporting built on top of them. Other related checklists (TRC, CCTB, Silman's Imbalances) exist and could be added as presets later if the feature takes off — not needed for v1.

## 2. Problem Statement

Players who review their games regularly still struggle to answer: *"What do I actually keep doing wrong?"*

- Engine evaluation tells you *that* a move was bad, not *why* it happened from the player's own perspective.
- Without a record, patterns fade from memory fast.
- Even a player who notices a pattern has no easy way to confirm it's improving, or whether it's just been replaced by a subtler one.
- Many chess coaches say keeping a log of your game analysis is important — but rarely explain how to actually do it in practice.

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Tagging a moment
While reviewing a game (ideally right after playing it, but equally usable on old games from the library), the player marks specific moments worth a takeaway. Following Studer's method, the target is **at most three per game** — a guiding constraint, not a hard limit. The UI encourages this in the product's own words (piling on more takeaways dilutes the lesson rather than sharpening it) and asks "Are you sure?" if the player tries to tag a fourth — a nudge, not a block.

Tagging is always a manual, human act; the system never suggests or auto-detects tag-worthy moments.

### 3.2 One active preset, chosen in Settings — not in the tagging dialog
Rather than showing every preset as a tab inside the tagging dialog each time (forcing a choice on every single tag), the player picks one **active preset** in a new **Chess Log Settings** dialog, reachable from the Chess Log menu — the same pattern CARA already uses for Engines and AI Summary setup. Tagging a moment then just uses whichever preset is currently active, with no in-the-moment picker to think about.

The player can switch the active preset at any time. Because of this, a single game (or a whole library, over time) can end up with moments tagged under more than one preset — some tagged while CLAMP was active, others later while 3x3 was active. That's expected, not an error state; see §5 for how reporting handles a mixed history.

### 3.3 The four presets
- **CLAMP** (Dr. Kabadayi) — More than one letter can apply to a single moment (e.g. a combined C+L or A+M failure):
  - **C**hecks — missed or overlooked checking moves, for either side.
  - **L**oose Pieces — a piece or a square left undefended or insufficiently defended.
  - **A**lignment — pieces sharing a file, rank, or diagonal in a way that creates a tactic (pins, skewers, discovered attacks), as well as knight forks.
  - **M**obility — a piece that's trapped, has no safe squares, or lacks the mobility the position calls for.
  - **P**awn Promotion — miscalculating or overlooking promotion races and endgame dynamics.
- **CCT** — the checks/captures/threats framing, more widely known than CLAMP among improving players. Same multi-select behavior as CLAMP: the player marks which of Checks, Captures, or Threats they missed, more than one allowed on one moment.
  - **C**hecks — a checking move, by either side, that wasn't considered.
  - **C**aptures — a capture, by either side, that wasn't considered.
  - **T**hreats — a non-capturing threat (to a piece, square, or plan) that wasn't considered.
- **3x3 (Studer's method)** — three guided Whys per moment: *Why did I make this move? Why was it suboptimal? Why is the engine's suggestion better?* Unlike the other three presets, 3x3's answers are free-form text, not selected from a fixed set — the three Whys *are* the tag.
- **Custom** — the player defines their own tag vocabulary ahead of time in Chess Log Settings (a managed, editable list — add, rename, remove). At tagging time, Custom is **not** free-form text entry; the player picks from that predefined list, same multi-select behavior as CLAMP/CCT. Free-form category entry only exists for 3x3's Whys, nowhere else.

### 3.4 The tag pair: what + why
For CLAMP, CCT, and Custom, each tagged moment is a pair: the **what** (the category or categories selected — e.g. "M" for a trapped rook) and, optionally, the **why** — a short note in the player's own words explaining the category. Example: category **M**, note: *"Rook became trapped when I moved my bishop, cutting off the Rook escape square."*

The why stays optional for these three presets — the category alone is enough to satisfy a tag. The reverse is also supported: a moment can be saved with **no category selected at all**, as long as the why-note has content — for cases where none of the active preset's categories genuinely fit the mistake (e.g. a strategic or king-safety error that isn't a tactical CLAMP/CCT concept). This is deliberately *not* a fake "Other" category — the entry saves as genuinely uncategorized rather than being force-fit under a letter that misrepresents it. A moment can't be saved with both no category and no why — one of the two is required. Custom's separate empty-picklist case (no categories defined at all yet) is unaffected by this and still blocks saving with a warning, since that's a configuration gap rather than an honest non-match.

For 3x3, the equivalent role is filled by the three guided Whys themselves, which are inherently free text rather than a separate optional note bolted onto a category pick.

The why half (or the 3x3 Whys) may be the richest data Chess Log collects: the what says *what kind* of mistake recurred; the why says *why*, and an AI reading it across months can surface patterns the player wouldn't spot from tag counts alone.

### 3.5 Prompting the existing whole-game note
CARA already has a whole-game note field — Chess Log doesn't add a new one. What changes: when the player tags a moment in a game that doesn't yet have that note filled in, Chess Log prompts them to add one. Still optional, still just a nudge — but it captures the reflection while the player is already in that frame of mind, and the AI narrative summary draws on it.

## 4. Workflow

1. Before first use (and any time they want to change methods), the player sets their active preset — CLAMP, CCT, 3x3, or Custom — in Chess Log Settings, reachable from the Chess Log menu. Custom users also manage their tag list there.
2. Player finishes a game and reviews it in CARA, as they already do today.
3. While stepping through the moves, they tag up to three moments using whichever preset is currently active, with an optional why note on any of them (3x3 answers its Whys as free text directly; the others pair a category pick with an optional note — or, per §3.4, no category with a required why).
4. If the game's whole-game note isn't filled in, tagging a moment prompts the player to add one.
5. Tags and notes accumulate across the library over time — including backfilled older games, an explicit, expected use case. The active preset can change between sessions, so the library may end up with moments tagged under more than one preset.
6. Whenever the player opens the Chess Log charts view, the trend charts and narrative summary are there — with a brief generation pause, the same way CARA's existing Player Stats view behaves today.

## 5. Reporting & Visualization

### 5.1 Trend charts
- Scope: the trend chart and narrative summary only cover games from PGN files currently open in CARA — the same constraint Player Stats already has, and for the same reason (aggregation works against games CARA has in memory, not a background scan of everything the player has ever saved). Chess Log is a view over what's loaded, not a standing archive.
- Uses CARA's existing timeline groupings rather than introducing a new time-window concept.
- A line chart of tag frequency by category over time, matching CARA's existing charting style.
- The chart should make **category mix shift** visible, not just total count. A player who traded hanging pieces for endgame promotion mistakes hasn't failed to improve — they've moved on to a harder problem. Total count alone hides that; the per-category breakdown reveals it.
- Uncategorized moments (per §3.4 — a moment saved with no category, why-note only) should appear as their own visible bucket in the chart, not be silently dropped or folded into an existing category. They're real data — a recurring pattern of "nothing in this preset fits" is itself worth seeing, and may be a signal the active preset doesn't cover something the player keeps running into.
- Since the active preset can change over time (§3.2), a player's history may mix vocabularies — some moments tagged under CLAMP, others later under 3x3. Charts should present a separate breakdown per preset used (e.g. a CLAMP chart and a 3x3 chart both derivable from the same history) rather than merging incompatible category vocabularies into one chart.
- Implementation note: CARA already has a time-series charting engine in `player_stats_service.py` (date binning, per-color series, configurable charts) behind its existing accuracy/move-quality trend charts. Chess Log's category-frequency chart should plug into that existing machinery rather than build parallel charting logic.

### 5.2 Narrative summary
Appears on the Chess Log charts view, for whatever time window the player selects there, with a brief generation pause like the rest of the view. **Only available if the player has configured an LLM in CARA** — an existing, optional CARA setting, not something Chess Log requires. Without one configured, the charts still work; there's just no narrative summary.

Generated by an LLM from the accumulated category tags, why notes, and whole-game notes, surfacing recurring themes in plain language. The why notes are expected to carry the most weight, since they say *why* a pattern recurs in the player's own words, not just that it did.

As part of the same read-through, the AI also flags notes that are too shallow to be useful — e.g. a why note that just restates the category ("I hung my bishop" for a tag already categorized as **L**, with no actual reason given). These are surfaced informationally alongside the summary, not as a separate nag or notification; there's no revisit workflow yet for jumping back to fix a flagged note — that's a later problem. The AI never rewrites or drafts a better note on the player's behalf; it only flags.

## 6. Success Criteria

No single hard KPI — this is a reflection tool, not a performance-management tool. Signals of success:

- The trend chart is genuinely informative about how the *mix* of mistakes changes over time, not just whether a count goes up or down.
- The narrative summary — especially from the player's own why notes — surfaces patterns the player hadn't consciously noticed.
- Tagging stays fast enough to survive real post-game habits rather than becoming a chore.

A rising or falling raw tag count is not, by itself, a meaningful signal.
